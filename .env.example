# ==========================================
# Cumments Environment Configuration Example
# ==========================================
# Copy this file to .env and update the values.

# --- Matrix Configuration (Required) ---
# Your Matrix homeserver URL (API endpoint)
# Note: For self-hosted servers, ensure this points to your actual Matrix instance
CUMMENTS_MATRIX_HOMESERVER=https://matrix.org

# Bot's full user ID
# The server name will be automatically parsed from this value
CUMMENTS_MATRIX_USER=@your_bot_name:matrix.org

# Bot's access token
# How to obtain: Login to Element Web → Settings → Help & About → Advanced → Access Token
CUMMENTS_MATRIX_TOKEN=syt_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# --- Database Configuration ---
# SQLite database connection string
# Recommended to keep the data/ prefix - the application will create this directory automatically
CUMMENTS_DATABASE_URL=sqlite://data/cumments.db

# [Development Note]
# Uncomment the line below if you need to run `cargo sqlx prepare` or `sqlx migrate` commands.
# This is necessary because SQLx compile-time macros cannot recognize the CUMMENTS_ prefix.
# DATABASE_URL=sqlite://data/cumments.db

# --- Network Configuration ---
# Host address to bind to. Use 0.0.0.0 for Docker or cloud environments
CUMMENTS_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Port to listen on. Change if port conflicts occur
CUMMENTS_PORT=3000

# [Compatibility Note]
# The application also supports standard PORT and HOST environment variables
# (for compatibility with platforms like Heroku/Railway)
# PORT=3000

# --- Logging Configuration ---
# Log level configuration
# Recommendation: Application modules at info, Matrix SDK at error (reduces sync noise)
RUST_LOG=server=info,adapter=info,storage=info,matrix_sdk=error,matrix_sdk_base=error
